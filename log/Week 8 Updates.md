 Work on your WebFlow website. See Canvas for requirements and reference links. 

## Q&A
Answers to common questions. 

* Will WebFlow site be graded? 
	* Yes. 
* Will CodePen Project — made in class — be graded? 
	* No. We will not grade the “Monster Truck” website. It is practice. 
* Will we need to a CodePen Project for our Portfolio? 
	* No. If you want to use WebFlow that’s fine. 
	* Yes, but *not* for Web 1. We’ll add to it in Web 2 and Web 3. Again the goal of Web 1 is for you have a Portfolio site you own. 
* What about our domain names? 
	* I will show you how to set it up for both WebFlow and CodePen. Seeing the pros and cons of both are goals of this class.
